There are only three categories of food: soup, salads, and sandwiches. This is the Lunch Special Theory. It's a simple theory that can help you make better decisions about what to eat for lunch.

The Lunch Special Theory is based on the idea that there are only three categories of food: soup, salads, and sandwiches. These three categories cover a wide range of foods and can help you make better decisions about what to eat for lunch.

When you're trying to decide what to eat for lunch, think about what category of food you're in the mood for. Are you in the mood for something warm and comforting? Then soup might be the way to go. Are you in the mood for something light and refreshing? Then a salad might be the best choice. Are you in the mood for something hearty and filling? Then a sandwich might be the answer.
